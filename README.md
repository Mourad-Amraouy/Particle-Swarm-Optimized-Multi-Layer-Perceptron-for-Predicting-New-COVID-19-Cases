# Particle-Swarm-Optimized-Multi-Layer-Perceptron-for-Predicting-New-COVID-19-Cases

In this cutting-edge project, we embark on a mission to harness the power of artificial intelligence and optimization techniques to forecast the number of new COVID-19 cases accurately. We employ a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, a powerful neural network architecture, to tackle this critical challenge. What sets our approach apart is the utilization of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to fine-tune the learning rate of the MLP model.
